# project-euler-python

The personal archive of Python solutions for [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives).

Per the rule about sharing solutions outside of Project Euler, I will only add solutions for the first 100 problems.

I will try to write my codes as Pythonic as possible, provide comments, and constantly refactor these codes.
